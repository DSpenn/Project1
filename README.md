# vibe-cloud-project

## Project Description
The goal of VibeCloud project is to create an application that lets users explore the vibes of restaurants in their ZIP code by presenting a word cloud of restaurant reviews.

Our application uses two APIs to generate review word clouds. The first API returns a list of restaurants in a ZIP code provided by the user, as well reviews of those restaurants. The second API generates a word cloud from the text of the returned reviews.


## User Story
